# wace/resources
A compilation of all Google Drive & other resources uploaded to the server, sorted by subject > year > section.
Where appropriate, folders are marked by what they lack (eg. NO SOLS).

## I want to download everything for subject X
(WIP): Head on over to the Releases section to get a ZIP file containing all resources for whatever subject you need.

## My subject doesn't have many resources
Not all subjects are as popular as each other, nor are there as many resources available. Collecting papers is a neverending process, we're never going to be able to sufficient resources for everyone, but unfortunately that's just the nature of things.

## I have something to contribute
Feel free to send it to the server or fork this repo!

## Why are English and Literature together
A lot of the English content is applicable for Literature studies and vice versa. Similarly some texts can be studied in both subjects, so the book_notes section must inherently belong to both subjects.
